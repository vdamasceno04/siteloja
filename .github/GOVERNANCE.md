# Governance

This document outlines the governance model for `VRL`. This includes detailed descriptions of different roles, nomination processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement.

**All community members must follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**  

## Get Involved

**Anything that supports us is a valuable contribution!**

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, type fixes and marketing.

Two important things that we look for in a contributor are:

- **Being here** - Thank you for being a part of this project with us.
- **Being a positive member of our community** - Go above and beyond our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and commit to healthy communication across pull requests, issue discussions and any interactions outside of our community.

Contributors can voluntarily leave the project at any time.

### Review

If a report doesnâ€™t contain enough information, the reviewers will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.

The reviewers will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
- Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation.

The reviewers should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if not agreed within a week, they will inform the parties of the planned date.

### Resolution

Responses will be determined by the reviewers on the basis of the information gathered and of the potential consequences. It may include:

- taking no further action
- issuing a reprimand (private or public)
- asking for an apology (private or public)
- permanent ban from the GitHub org
- revoked contributor status
